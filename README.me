# OCSP Fetcher

## Usage
I hope you already have node installed :)))

First install node dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Then run with the following:
```bash
node ocspFetch.js <Cert-chain>
```
An example cert-chain can be found in `openssl_ocsp_certchain`. You can pass in raw cert chain resposnes from an openssl command like 
```bash
openssl s_client -connect wikipedia.org:443 -showcerts 2>&1 < /dev/null
```
thanks to some nifty regex handling.
